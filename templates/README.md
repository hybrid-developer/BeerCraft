# Templates
## Setup

To use templates in Android Studio copy the template folder into the Android Studio templates/other folder

This should be located in your Application folder, e.g: Applications/Android Studio <version_number> Preview.app/Contents/plugins/android/lib/templates/other/

Once a template folder is imported you should be able to create code using the template shortcut. e.g. by selecting File > New > Zavaitar > MVI Template Fragment
